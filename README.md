~~~~~~~ THE README FILE, THE THING ALMOST EVERY PROGRAM HAS BUT IS FAMOUSLY NEVER READ ~~~~~~~

Tired of having to constantly take care of your dog? Sick of having to clean up after it wherever you go?

Presenting the Digital Frenchie! Now you can get rid of the breathing and pooping companion for life and enjoy some quality time with a digital version
that doesn't need to be fed, walked or cleaned up after!

Pet your Digital Frenchie's cute little face and it will love you just like your parents never did!

You can even boop it's little nose! Be careful, it doesn't really like being booped, and the more you boop it the more annoyed it'll be. 
Don't worry though, no matter how annoyed it gets, it won't do anything to you (for now *dramatic music*). Besides, it's just an animation, so who cares what it feels? 
Simply pet it and it will love you again (but it will never forget the trauma of the boop).

~~~~~~~ HOW TO USE ~~~~~~~

- Press the RUN button on the top left hand corner.
- Enter whatever name you want into the dialogue box and it will appear on your Frenchie's name tag! The engravers are expensive though, so there's a 5-character limit.
- To pet your Frenchie, LEFT CLICK & DRAG your mouse over the cute little face.
- To boop your Frenchie, RIGHT CLICK on its little nose. The more you boop, the more annoyed it'll be, and rather than trying to guess how annoyed it is you can see it in the console.
- Once you're tired of annoying or showing affection to your Digital Frenchie simply close the window and it will be quickly put down, so you have a fresh one next time you start!

~~~~~~~ KNOWN EXISTING ISSUES ~~~~~~~

- If the "Cancel" button is clicked when naming your Frenchie in the initial dialogue box the animation will not run.
- Dialogue box can appear small, size cannot be changed.
